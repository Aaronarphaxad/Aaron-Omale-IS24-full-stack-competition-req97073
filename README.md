## Notes:
Due to personal obligations, there are certain features I could not add because I am short of time, but it was great to build this. I really much enjoyed building the app. If I had more time, I would've loved to improve the following features:

- Form flow of create product process. So the user will only see error messages when they attempt to save without filling the forms.
- Overall styling and alignments of forms to create/edit.
